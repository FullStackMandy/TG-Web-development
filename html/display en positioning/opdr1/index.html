    <h1>Display and positioning</h1>
    <h2>Opdracht 1</h2>
    <p>There are five position properties:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Static</li>
        <li>Relative</li>
        <li>Fixed</li>
        <li>Absolute</li>
        <li>Sticky</li>
    </ol>
    <p>1) An html element is positioned: static; bij default.
        Static positioned elements are not affected bij: left, right,top, bottom properties.
        A static positioned element is not positioned is a special way, it just follows the flow of the page.
    </p>
    <p>
        2)An html element with position: relative; is positioned relative to it's normal position.
        If you use (top, bottom, left, right properties) the relative positioned element will change from its normal position.
        Other content will not take up the space wich is left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
        3)An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. 
        Top, right, bottom, left properties are used to position the element.
         A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.
    </p>
    <p>
        4)An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
        However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
        A "positioned" element is one whose position is anything except static.
    </p>
    <p>
        5)An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.
        A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).
    </p>
